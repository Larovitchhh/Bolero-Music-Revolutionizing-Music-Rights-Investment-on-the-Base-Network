In a pivotal move announced in early October 2025, Bolero Music migrated its registry to Base, Coinbase's Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) network.

 This upgrade addresses the growing demands of music rights as a digital asset class by offering lower transaction fees, enhanced scalability, and seamless integration with the broader onchain ecosystem.

 Base's infrastructure enables faster, cheaper operations compared to mainnet Ethereum, making it ideal for high-volume royalty distributions and secondary market trades.

The migration coincides with Bolero's availability in the Base app (formerly Coinbase Wallet), exposing music rights investing to millions of users and fostering deeper liquidity. 

 CEO William Bailey highlighted Base's rapid growth and supportive team as key factors in the decision, positioning Bolero to scale globally while maintaining artist commissions on trades.

 This shift not only reduces barriers for everyday investors but also aligns with industry trends where music catalogs are increasingly viewed as high-yield, data-rich assets, as noted in reports from Goldman Sachs and IFPI.
